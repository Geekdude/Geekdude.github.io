    Aaron,
    When you add your latest paper to your web page, let me know and I'll notify the grandparents and Del so they can scan it and be impressed.

    When I was searching for your blog, the above also popped up. You might consider linking it to your web page, too.

    Congratulations on the publication being finalized!

    Love,
    Mom
