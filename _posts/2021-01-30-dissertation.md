My dissertation titled *SNACC: The Scaled-up Neuromorphic Array Communications Controller* is now available at [https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/5843/](https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/5843/). 

I have also made available two general-purpose IP blocks written in VHDL that I created as part of my dissertation work. They are a custom Aurora acknowledgment automatic repeat request design available at [https://github.com/Geekdude/aurora-ack](https://github.com/Geekdude/aurora-ack) and a AXI4-Stream clock converter design available at [https://github.com/Geekdude/axi4-stream-clock-converter](https://github.com/Geekdude/axi4-stream-clock-converter).
