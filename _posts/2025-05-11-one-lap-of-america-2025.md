My dad and I recently completed our fourth year of Brock Yates' One Lap of America 2025 driving competition. For some reason, we keep coming back ðŸ¤ª. I'm just kidding; it is a lot of fun.

The One Lap of America official website is [onelapofamerica.com](https://www.onelapofamerica.com).
Since the event was technically a competition, the events were time trials. Each team was scored and ranked based on how fast they completed each event.
The event results and rankings can be found on the [One Lap of America website](https://www.onelapofamerica.com) under History -> Previous One Laps.Â 

My dad's 2023 Chevrolet C8 Stingray has now completed three One Laps of America.
Our team number was 50, and with our lower number, we were not quite able to be beat our number, finishing 54<sup>th</sup> overall. Our goal, as always, is not to place well but to have fun, complete the event, and bring the car back home, and we completed all of these goals.
