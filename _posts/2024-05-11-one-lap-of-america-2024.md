My dad and I recently completed our third year of Brock Yates' One Lap of America 2024 driving competition. For some reason, we keep coming back ðŸ¤ª. I'm just kidding; it is a lot of fun.

This year, I edited the videos and compiled the pictures while in transit. I also started and completed going through [last year's pictures/videos]({% link _posts/2023-05-13-one-lap-of-america-2023.md %}). 
This year, we got a nice rhythm down. After the event in the morning, I would take the first shift of the transit. Then, when we ran low on gas, we would stop at a gas station, and I would collect the SD cards to download and process the photos and video during the second transition before switching again and driving the rest of the transit for that day.

The One Lap of America official website is [onelapofamerica.com](https://www.onelapofamerica.com). 
Since the event was technically a competition, the events were time trials. Each team was scored and ranked based on how fast they completed each event.
The event results and rankings can be found on the [One Lap of America website](https://www.onelapofamerica.com) under History -> Previous One Laps.Â 

My dad's 2023 Chevrolet C8 Stingray has now completed two One Laps of America.
Our team number was 55, and we beat our number for the first time, finishing 50<sup>th</sup> overall. Our goal, as always, was not to place well but to have fun, complete the event, and bring the car back home, and we completed all of these goals. The track route was really nice this year, and the trip overall seemed easier this year than in past years. The time zones usually changed in our favor for the long days and we maintained good sleep starting out.
