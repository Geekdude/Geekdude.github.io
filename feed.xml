With them, Vim can jump between symbols to quickly go to the definition of symbols or find keywords within the document.
Ctags + Vim end up working very similar to how &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; or other IDEs “go to definition” and “find all symbols works.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ctags.sourceforge.net/whatis.html&quot;&gt;ctags website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility. A tag signifies a language object for which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index entry created for that object).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ctags-with-vim&quot;&gt;Ctags with Vim&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ctags can be annoying to use because you have to run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ctags&lt;/code&gt; program to generate a tag file, which then needs to be found by Vim to be used.
If the code changes, then the tag file will need to be re-updated.
One way to set up ctags is to map a Vim keypress to generate the ctags.
In my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vimrc&lt;/code&gt;, I set it up to regenerate ctags when I press &amp;lt;F5&amp;gt; while not in a &lt;img src=&quot;http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt; file.
More on the ctags command later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-viml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&quot; Set f5 to generate tags for non-latex files&lt;/span&gt;
augroup TexTags
autocmd&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; TexTags
autocmd &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;FileType&lt;/span&gt; tex &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;b:latex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
augroup &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;exists&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;b:latex&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    nnoremap &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;f5&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:!&lt;/span&gt;ctags &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;R&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;CR&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to generating the ctags, you also need to tell Vim where to find the generated tag files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-viml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&quot; Ctags search&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=.&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;;$HOME
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tags string says to search for the file &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.tags&lt;/code&gt; in the current file’s directory and recursively search upward until the user’s home directory is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ctags-with-vim-and-git&quot;&gt;Ctags with Vim and Git&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I do not manually generate the ctags file with &amp;lt;F5&amp;gt;.
I store all my source code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, so instead of manually generating the ctags file, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks&quot;&gt;githooks&lt;/a&gt; to automatically generate the ctags files whenever I checkout, commit, merge, or rewrite.
To setup githooks to be added automatically to newly cloned or created git repos, you make a git template with the correct files.
The git template will be copied into the new repositories &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; folder on creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, setup the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git_template&lt;/code&gt; structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.git_template/
└── hooks
    ├── ctags
    ├── post-checkout
    ├── post-commit
    ├── post-merge
    └── post-rewrite

1 directory, 5 files
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ctags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;git rev-parse &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--show-toplevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;trap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'rm -f &quot;$dir/.$$.tags&quot;'&lt;/span&gt; EXIT
ctags &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--tag-relative&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--extra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;+f &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;.tags&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--languages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-javascript&lt;/span&gt;,sql
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;.tags&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/.tags&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;post-checkout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git rev-parse &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--git-dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$dir&lt;/span&gt;/hooks/ctags &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;post-commit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git rev-parse &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--git-dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$dir&lt;/span&gt;/hooks/ctags &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;post-merge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git rev-parse &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--git-dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$dir&lt;/span&gt;/hooks/ctags &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;post-rewrite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git rev-parse &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--git-dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in
  &lt;/span&gt;rebase&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$dir&lt;/span&gt;/hooks/post-merge &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;esac&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have to add the template to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[init]
    templatedir = ~/.git_template
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now more about the ctags command.
To use the command, you first have to install ctags.
I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://ctags.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;exuberant-ctags&lt;/a&gt; which can be installed with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt install exuberant-ctags&lt;/code&gt; on Ubuntu or Debian based Linux.
The ctags command I use is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ctags -R --tag-relative --extra=+f -f&quot;$dir/.$$.tags&quot; --languages=-javascript,sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-R&lt;/code&gt; recurses into directories.
The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--tag-relative&lt;/code&gt; sets file paths relative to the tag file.
The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--extra=+f&lt;/code&gt; includes the entry for the base file name of every source file.
The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; specifies that the tag file should be saved at the root of the git repository as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.tags&lt;/code&gt;.
Finally, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--languages&lt;/code&gt; removes javascript and SQL from the languages which get tagged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, this template will only apply to new git repositories; therefore, I also created two &lt;a href=&quot;https://fishshell.com/&quot;&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; functions to reload git hooks based on the git template.
One file reloads hooks in a git repo without submodules, and the other one recursively updates the hooks of all submodules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git-reload-hooks.fish&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function git-reload-hooks --description 'Reload git hooks'
rm -f (git rev-parse --git-dir)/hooks/*
git init
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git-reload-hooks-all.fish&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function git-reload-hooks-all --description 'Reload all git hooks'
    git submodule foreach --recursive 'rm -f $(git rev-parse --git-dir)/hooks/*;git init'
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all of this seems like a lot to setup, I recommend storing all your linux dotfiles in a git repository with a script to symlink the files to the right location.
I plan to create a future post with more detail on how this is done.&lt;/p&gt;

I have since modified my setup to work better with git submodules and other edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Young</name><email>youngar@ornl.gov</email></author><category term="Git" /><category term="Vim" /><category term="Ctags" /><summary type="html">Ctags with Vim are incredibly useful for quickly navigating around code.

I always planned on migrating to GitHub pages post-graduation; that was one reason I chose to build my website using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.
GitHub pages can host any static website, but it is designed to build and work with Jekyll sites automatically.
I wanted to migrate my website properly with correct redirection and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
Overall the process was relatively easy, but I did run into some issues, primarily with the customizations I have done to the website.
This post will cover the overall steps I took and also the issues and workarounds I encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-the-site-to-github&quot;&gt;Moving the site to GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I have been hosting my repository as a private repo in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/&quot;&gt;bitbucket&lt;/a&gt;.
I decided to move the repository to a public &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repo since I used GitHub pages for hosting.
At first, I tried just to move my repository over directly and use GitHub’s built-in building of Jekyll.
However, this auto-building feature only supports a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#plugins&quot;&gt;subset of Jekyll plugins&lt;/a&gt;.
The plugin I use for pagination, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2&quot;&gt;Jekyll Paginate V2&lt;/a&gt;, is not one of the supported plugins.
This limitation means that the built-in building would not work for my site without changing the plugins I use.
Therefore, I turned off the automatic Jekyll building by adding a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.nojekyll&lt;/code&gt; file to the root of the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then tried to build the site automatically with GitHub Actions, but I had trouble getting the site to build using a docker image with the Jekyll build action.
While looking into the build issues, I realized my website would not build with the newest versions of Jekyll and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/&quot;&gt;Minimal Mistakes&lt;/a&gt;.
By finding a copy of the Gemfile.lock file I used to build the website with last, I was able to roll back to the old versions and build my website correctly again.
Again, the issue was related to the custom template files I created to use Paginate V2 for my home pages and article pages.
The trouble with Jekyll and extension versions leads me to an important lessons learned:
&lt;strong&gt;Store the Gemfile.lock in version control so that you can diagnose issues caused by building with newer versions of the tools and extensions.&lt;/strong&gt;
I was lucky and could just pull the lock file from my backups which saved me extra debugging time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I like the way my website looks and I didn’t want to spend extra time porting my template to the newer version, I decided to keep building the website locally and uploading the static site for hosting.
Luckily GitHub Pages supports this flow.
The static website can be uploaded to the main branch or a branch called gh-pages.
Actually, the branch and path can be chosen under Settings -&amp;gt; Options -&amp;gt; GitHub Pages, so any location can be used for the source.
At first, I tested uploading the built website to the main branch, and the website was hosted as expected.
But I then decided to host the website’s source in the main branch and a gh-pages branch to host the built website.
To make the whole process simpler, I wanted to update my deploy script to build and deploy the website to a branch in the repository.
At first, I was hesitant to store the built files in the repo, but since the files are in an orphaned branch, they are separate from the main branch.
The orphan branch (as opposed to a folder in the main branch) will make cleaning the files up easier, if they get too large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily updating the build script was easy since I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy&quot;&gt;Git Directory Deploy&lt;/a&gt; script that I could leverage to copy the built site directory to a separate orphaned git branch.
Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Geekdude/Geekdude.github.io/blob/master/deploy.sh&quot;&gt;my deploy script&lt;/a&gt; just calls a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Geekdude/Geekdude.github.io/blob/master/deploy_github.sh&quot;&gt;customized version of the git deploy script&lt;/a&gt; with the variables filled in for my site.
Previously it would use rsync to copy the build files to the EECS servers website folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I decided to use the same local build then deploy setup, minimal changes were needed to the site itself.
I updated the site URL in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Geekdude/Geekdude.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/a&gt; as well as updated the previously mentioned deploy scripts.
That was all that was required to migrate the site and start hosting on GitHub Pages. The source code for the site can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Geekdude/Geekdude.github.io&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Geekdude/Geekdude.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-redirection&quot;&gt;Setting up redirection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to set up redirection from the old URL to the new URL.
After looking into redirection, I discovered that I wanted to use redirection with the permanent redirection status (301) which indicates that the resource has moved permanently.
From various posts, I learned that a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; file is used on linux servers to specify server-level redirects.
I had trouble finding the correct redirect commands until I read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_alias.html#redirect&quot;&gt;Apache Documentation for Redirect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_alias.html#redirectmatch&quot;&gt;RedirectMatch&lt;/a&gt;.
The trouble I ran into was how to correctly map from a folder on a domain to a domain (i.e. /~ayoung48 to /).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; file that ended up working properly is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RedirectMatch 301 &quot;/~ayoung48/(.*)&quot; &quot;https://Geekdude.github.io/$1&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This redirect match command would correctly redirect pages from the old site to the new site.
I will leave up this redirection until I lose access to the UTK servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;search-engine-optimization&quot;&gt;Search Engine Optimization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the redirection was setup in the previous section, updating the search optimization is easier.
I added the new site to &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.google.com/search-console/about&quot;&gt;Google Search Console&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bing.com/webmasters&quot;&gt;Microsoft Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt;.
There did not seem to be an explicit place to let them know about the move&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but with redirection and having both sites listed under my account, I hope their web crawler will figure it out.
I do not even need to redo the website verification method since it was already done for the old address and the verification files are still in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-comments&quot;&gt;Moving Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving comments with Discus was easy as well.
Since I have 301 redirection set up, I could just go into Admin -&amp;gt; Moderate Comments -&amp;gt; Tools -&amp;gt; Migration Tools and use the Redirect Crawler.
Then Discus ported the two comments I had on my old site to the new site.
I also discovered that I am not getting email notifications when people comment.
I will need to look into why.
The settings are correctly set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There was one for google but it required Domain level property types, not URL Prefix like I am using. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

I can almost go through a whole loaf by myself when it is fresh from the oven.
Sourdough bread also makes the best french toast and great bread crumbs for wiener schnitzel.
This post will go over the basics to getting started making sourdough bread.
It includes links to the resources I used to get started, my favorite recipes, and some tips and tricks I have learned over my years of baking and experimenting for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;starter&quot;&gt;Starter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I tried to make my own starter.
This didn’t really work out all that well.
I learned that you should not try to make a sourdough starter by initially adding in baking yeast.
If you do this, you will not get the good sourdough flavor and it will be harder to form the symbiotic relationship between bacteria and wild yeast which gives sourdough its unique acidic flavor.
After a first bland attempt and subsequent difficulty to get a starter to grow with wild yeast (i.e.
with only flour and water).
I decided to buy &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/classic-fresh-sourdough-starter-1-oz&quot;&gt;starter from King Arthur Flour&lt;/a&gt;.
This starter worked much better.
I bought it in 2013 and I have kept it going ever since.
I keep the sourdough starter in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/classic-king-arthur-sourdough-crock&quot;&gt;King Arthur Sourdough Crock&lt;/a&gt;.
They also sale the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/sourdough-starter-and-crock-set&quot;&gt;starter in a set with the crock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;starter-care&quot;&gt;Starter Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Arthur Flour provides a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kingarthurflour.com/learn/guides/sourdough&quot;&gt;sourdough guide&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to get started with sourdough bread.
It includes information on how to maintain a starter as well as how to bake bread.
This is where I first started and I still use much of what I learned here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally end up neglecting my starter for a few months at a time when I get busy and didn’t have time to bake.
The starter will do well for this long in the fridge.
Do not freeze the starter since doing so could harm the microbes.
If I’m not planing on using my starer within the next few days, I will keep it in the fridge.
The cold slows down the activity of the organisms which also slows down the rate they consume the flour.
After a while, brown liquid will form on the top of the starter.
This is expected and can be mixed back into the starter before feeding.
If the starter ever shows signs of mold, has an orange or pink tint/streak or smells putrid then it went bad with harmful microorganism and you will want to throw it out.
I don’t know how common this is as mine has never spoiled.
The smell of sourdough is quite sharp but it should smell like beer or bread and not like spoiled food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I feed my starter I mix together a cup of starter, a cup of water, and a cup of flour.
I usually use a scale which means I mix together 172 grams of starter, water, and flour.
You can vary the ratios, but I found that the same amount of each works well.
I aim for a pancake batter like consistency.
Too much water and there isn’t as much food.
Too much flour and the starter can expand outside the container and makes a mess.
A nice balance will bubble, but not trap the air so that it expands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between a fed and unfed starter.
A fed starer is active and bubbling.
Typically, you can feed the starter and wait a few hours and it will be active.
An unfed starter is straight from the fridge before feeding.
If it has been a long time since I fed the starter, I will feed it, let it sit at room temperature for a day, feed it again, and wait for it to appear active before I consider it fed.
I have made bread with both fed and unfed starter.
The fed starter makes it easier to get fluffier bread but unfed still works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great trick I learned is that you can easily transfer starter by taking some of it and adding lots of flour so that it forms a dry ball.
The dry ball can then be stored in the top of a bag of flour you are taking on a trip.
I have used this to transfer my starter when I traveled to visit relatives and I wanted to make sourdough bread for them.
The bag of flour with dried starter in the top was much easier to transfer then the ceramic crock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sourdough-bread&quot;&gt;Sourdough Bread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bread making is as much an art as a science.
There are many factors at work to determine how the final loaf will turn out.
These variables include the activity of the starter, the water-to-flour ratio, and the time and temperatures for the various fermenting, proofing, and rising stages.
Although I started out following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/extra-tangy-sourdough-bread-recipe&quot;&gt;Extra-Tangy Sourdough Bread recipe&lt;/a&gt;, I also started experimenting with this recipe to learn how different ingredients and techniques affected the final loaf.
Now I still loosely follow the recipe, but I do it more from experience and practice then from precisely measuring everything.
My goal was actually to simplify the process as much as possible, down to the key ingredients, understand the role these ingredients play and then understand the phases of the proofing process.
I found that the bread mostly came out well every time and the variation was fun.
My current bread relies on simple ingredients and gets the great sourdough flavor from only the starter and the proofing steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approach to making bread has been shaped by reading a variety of books, reading internet posts, and from watching YouTube videos.
Of particular note is &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0825463149/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_gAoKEbRRY3PKE&quot;&gt;In Celebration of Simplicity: The Joy of Living Lightly&lt;/a&gt; which is about living a life based on gospel simplicity through an extended metaphor with the simple ingredients in bread.
This book inspired me to keep the ingredients simple and to understand the role of each.
The bread chapter in &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0143125338/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_ZHoKEb3MET40D&quot;&gt;Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation&lt;/a&gt; was very interesting and led me to experimenting with whole wheat sourdough bread and also to use wetter dough.
The whole wheat was very challenging, but I could eventually make a good sandwich bread loaf.
However, I could never get as yummy of an artesian loaf as I could with white flour.
The introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/Classic-Sourdoughs-Revised-Bakers-Handbook-ebook/dp/B004EWFUQ4/ref=sr_1_36?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=sourdough+bread&amp;amp;qid=1586731950&amp;amp;sr=8-36&quot;&gt;Classic Sourdoughs&lt;/a&gt; has a great, concise, introduction to the art of sourdough bread making with information on the various factors and how they affect the final loaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-method-of-baking-bread&quot;&gt;My Method of Baking Bread&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I will now walk you through my process making bread, but for a recipe and more details instructions follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/extra-tangy-sourdough-bread-recipe&quot;&gt;Extra-Tangy Sourdough Bread recipe&lt;/a&gt; and start experimenting.
I start off the day before by mixing together a small mason jar of water (2-ish cups), the leftover starter after feeding it, and a sifter full of flour (3-ish cups) in a large glass mixing bowl.
I spend a while mixing this together until it is quite smooth 1-3 minutes.
At this stage it should be uniform and still liquidy like pancake batter.
You want it to be liquidy so that it won’t overflow the bowl overnight.
Then let the bowl sit out on the counter until you go to bed, then move it into the fridge (I will leave it out all night if I used an unfed starter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I just add some salt, honey, and herbs.
With these ingreadients, I stopped measuring the amounts percisely.
Start with the amounts listed in the recipe, but after awhile you get a feel for the rough amounts and no longer have to measure precisely.
I like using thyme or a mix of Italian herbs.
For this part I take inspiration from Penelope Wilcock who says in &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0825463149/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_gAoKEbRRY3PKE&quot;&gt;In Celebration of Simplicity: The Joy of Living Lightly&lt;/a&gt; “When I add salt, yeast, honey and herbs into my bread, I just put in ‘some’. Approximate amounts will do, creating acceptable variants in the taste.”
I no longer add sour salt to my bread, since I am able to get a strong natural sourdough flavor without it.
At this point I also usually add in some olive oil.
If you want artesian bread, then leave the olive oil out.
But if you want sandwich bread with a softer crust include it.
The oil will reduce the size of the air pockets and make the crust softer and better for sandwich bread.
Again with the oil, I don’t measure precisely but pour in ‘some’ from my tin olive oil container.
I probably add around a tablespoon or two.
On the amount of oil to add, Penelope says “I put lots in.”
I mix everything together, so that it is uniformly combined.
Then I either dump it out onto a bed of flour or start adding flour while I am stirring.
I mix the added flour in with the dough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I should probably let the dough rest for a bit to autolyse but normally I forget and just start with the kneading.
While I knead I try to keep the dough as wet as I want to deal with, as I start to knead it using the “slap” kneading method.
This method is shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kingarthurflour.com/learn/guides/sourdough/bake&quot;&gt;King Arthur Kneading video&lt;/a&gt; and requires less effort than other methods and allows stickier dough to be handled.
This main kneading needs to be long and I do it for at least 10 minutes.
As you continue kneading the dough will start to get firmer and harder to knead.
This means you are closer to finishing.
I try to keep it sticky and will occasionally add flour to the outside to make it less sticky.
While I am kneading it, I add more flour based on the constency of the dough.
From &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0143125338/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_ZHoKEb3MET40D&quot;&gt;Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation&lt;/a&gt;, the wetter the dough, the better for artisan breads.
However, I like to find my happy middle ground with a sticky dough, but one that is dry enough to no lose its structure during the proofing process.
With really wet dough, you should fold the dough as it rises. With dryer dough, this is not required.
I would begin with the recipe and then start expirementing.
If you want to track expirements with the amount of ingredients in the recipe, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage&quot;&gt;baker’s percentage&lt;/a&gt;, which measures the ratio of other ingreadetants by weight to that of the flour.
Of great inportance is the dough hydration, which is the baker’s percentage of water.
Once I am done kneading, I clean the large mixing bowl the dough was in, coat it with olive oil, then add the dough back to the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bread-proof-initial.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;before proof&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I move the dough to my bread proofing box and wait a while.
You can easily make bread without a proofing box, but see more information about them &lt;a href=&quot;#bread-proofing-box&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I either try to fold the bread every 30 min to 1 hour, if I am doing a particular wet dough as this helps the gluten form better, or I just let it sit without attention.
Like the recipe says, I wait anywhere between 2 and 5 hours as I watch it occasionally to see how it is rising.
Once I am convinced it has risen well, I do the short knock back kneading for around 2 minutes, then I divide the dough into two halves, shape it, and either add it to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/king-arthur-standard-bread-loaf-pan-8-x-4&quot;&gt;bread loaf pan&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/round-brotform&quot;&gt;brotform&lt;/a&gt;.
Often I will do both to make a round artesian loaf and a sandwich loaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bread-proof-final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;after proof&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I let it rise in the proofing box for another 2 to 4 hours until it has risen.
Then I preheat the oven and bake the bread.
I spray the top of the bread with water (olive oil could also be used) and cut slits in the dough to let the air escape as it rises.
I usually start the oven off at 500°F for the first ten minutes to help the bread rise quickly.
Then I reduce the temperature to 425°F and add aluminum foil to prevent the crust from hardening as much as it finishes cooking for 15 to 20 more minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bread-final-rise.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;final rise&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished bread is great while it is still hot.
The second loaf can be frozen if you don’t plan on eating it for a few days.
The bread will last for about a week before it becomes stale.
Slightly stale bread works great for french toast (even better than fresh bread in fact since it keeps together better as it soaks up the egg/milk mix); also any leftover bread which is stale can be blended into bread crumbs and stored in the freezer.
For bread crumbs the bread either has to be stale or toasted in order to blend into good bread crumbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bread-cooked.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bread cooked&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;waffles&quot;&gt;Waffles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite waffle recipe is by far the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/classic-sourdough-waffles-or-pancakes-recipe&quot;&gt;Classic Sourdough Waffles or Pancakes&lt;/a&gt; from King Arthur Flour.
These Waffles have a great sourdough taste to them.
I have found that you can leave excess batter in the fridge and cook it subsequent days without issues.
I would try to eat it up within three days though.
I also found that the sourdough flavor is slightly stronger each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bread-waffle-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;waffle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bread-waffle-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;waffle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bread-proofing-box&quot;&gt;Bread Proofing Box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try using a proofing box to see if it would improve the quality of my sourdough bread.
However, I didn’t want to by a proofing box if it would not make a big impact.
So when I was thinking of a final group project idea for ECE551—Digital System Design, I decided to make my own “Smart” bread proofing box with temperature and humidity control, built-in automatic schedule, and a web interface.
The project was great fun and the final report can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/bread-proofing-report.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
As part of the project, I also experimented with making bread with the bread box.
I found that the flavors of the bread were better when the bread box was used.
At this time I also decided to stop using sour salt in my bread, since I could get great natural sour flavors in my bread and I didn’t want to cover them up with the sour salt.
The bread proofer we made for the class worked great, but I ended up getting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/folding-bread-proofer-and-slow-cooker&quot;&gt;commercial bread proofer&lt;/a&gt; mostly since it can fold down easily and was made out of sturdier materials.
The commercial bread proofer does lack a few of the features from the one I made.
It doesn’t have the proofing scheduling/timing, humidity control, or a web interface.
On the flip side the commercial one works well and folds down nicely.
However, its heating element works much better than the heat lamp I used.
The heat lamp would dry out the top of the dough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video shows the bread proofer I made in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common file naming practice is to prepend a number to the filename so that the files appear in the order specified by the number. However, say you want to add, delete, or reorder these files, you would have to go through and update all the filenames which have numbers changed from the operation. Although renaming the files like this is not hard, it’s annoying to do when there are multiple files which need to be renamed. I ran into this issue recently while writing my dissertation; each chapter is broken into its own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file stored in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chapters/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to insert a new chapter or delete a chapter, all the files which come after that chapter will have to be renamed. Further, more in the main &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file I include each of the chapters with an include statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\include{chapters/01-introduction}
\include{chapters/02-related-work}
\include{chapters/03-previous-work}
\include{chapters/04-goals}
\include{chapters/05-tools}
\include{chapters/06-danna2-work}
\include{chapters/07-snacc}
\include{chapters/08-challenges}
\include{chapters/09-applications-performance}
\include{chapters/10-accomplishments}
\include{chapters/11-future}
\include{chapters/12-conclusion}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means I have to renumber the files in the directory and the files in the include statements.
In order to make this operation easier, I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Geekdude/reorder&quot;&gt;reorder&lt;/a&gt; python script to easily rename, add, delete, and reorder the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*.tex&lt;/code&gt; files in the chapters directory. This script opens up a text buffer, and you make the desired changes to the buffer; then the script will make the changes to the directory and update the file numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I modified my makefile for the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\LaTeX&lt;/script&gt; project to include a target to build a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chapters.tex&lt;/code&gt; file with the proper include statements for the chapters found in the chapters folder. Now in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.tex&lt;/code&gt; I only need to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;chapters.tex&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if I want to add a new chapter between previous-work and goals, as well as rename “previous work” to “prior work”, all I need to do is run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reorder chapters&lt;/code&gt;. I am then presented with the buffer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;01-introduction.tex
02-related-work.tex
03-previous-work.tex
04-goals.tex
05-tools.tex
06-danna2-work.tex
07-snacc.tex
08-challenges.tex
09-applications-performance.tex
10-accomplishments.tex
11-future.tex
12-conclusion.tex
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then change the buffer to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;01-introduction.tex
02-related-work.tex
03-prior-work.tex
new-chapter
04-goals.tex
05-tools.tex
06-danna2-work.tex
07-snacc.tex
08-challenges.tex
09-applications-performance.tex
10-accomplishments.tex
11-future.tex
12-conclusion.tex
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I can rebuild the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\LaTeX&lt;/script&gt; document and the changes to the chapters will be included with a newly generated &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chapters.tex&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much appreciation to Jonathan Ambrose who helped come up with the idea for the script, motivated me to write it, and added several additional features to the script.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Young</name><email>youngar@ornl.gov</email></author><category term="File-Organization" /><summary type="html">I recently created a reorder python script to rename, reorder, add, and remove files/directories in a directory with a numerical naming scheme.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Big Orange Bramble</title><link href="https://geekdude.github.io/tech/bob/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Big Orange Bramble" /><published>2019-10-09T05:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-09T05:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://geekdude.github.io/tech/bob</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://geekdude.github.io/tech/bob/">&lt;p&gt;This year marks the three-year anniversary of the 64 node Raspberry Pi cluster known as the Big Orange Bramble or BOB.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project involved the design and construction of a high performance cluster composed of 68 quad-core ARMv8 64-bit Raspberry Pi 3s.
The primary intent of the project was to establish the operating environment, communication structure, application frameworks, application development tools, and libraries necessary to support the effective operation of a high performance computer model for the students and faculty in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department of the University of Tennessee to utilize.
As a foundation, the system borrowed heavily from the Tiny Titan system constructed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which was a similar but smaller-scale project consisting of 9 first generation Raspberry Pis.
Beyond the primary target of delivering a functional system, efforts were focused on application development, performance benchmarking, and delivery of a comprehensive build/usage guide to aid those who wish to build upon the efforts of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple neuromorphic systems use spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform computation in a way that is inspired by concepts learned about the human brain.
SNNs are artificial networks made up of neurons that fire a pulse, or spike, once the accumulated value of the inputs to the neuron exceeds a threshold.
One of the most challenging parts of designing neuromorphic hardware is handling the vast degree of connectivity that neurons have with each other in the form of synaptic connections.
This paper analyzes the neuromorphic systems Neurogrid, Braindrop, SpiNNaker, BrainScaleS, TrueNorth, Loihi, Darwin, and Dynap-SEL; and discusses the design of large scale spiking communication networks used in such systems.
In particular, this paper looks at how each of these systems solved the challenges of forming packets with spiking information and how these packets are routed within the system.
The routing of packets is analyzed at two scales: How the packets should be routed when traveling a short distance, and how the packets should be routed over longer global connections.
Additional topics, such as the use of asynchronous circuits, robustness in communication, connection with a host machine, and network synchronization are also covered.&lt;/p&gt;

We are researching a new paradigm of computing, inspired by the human brain.
Our research encompasses nearly every facet of the neuromorphic area, including current and emergent hardware implementations, theoretical models, programming techniques and applications.
Specifically, I have worked on framework development, the DANNA and DANNA2 digital neuromorphic processors, and neuromorphic application development.
I have also helped with the development of multiple neuromorphic robots, including NeoN (Neuromorphic Control System for Autonomous Robotic Navigation), GRANT (Ground-Roaming Autonomous Neuromorphic Targeter), and SABR (Self-Adjusting Balancing Robot).
My focus has been on communication between traditional computers and neuromorphic processors.
I have developed the NACC (Neuromorphic Array Communications Controller) to support high-speed, low-latency communication between the host PC and the neuromorphic system.
I have also designed and built SNACC (Scaled-up Neuromorphic Array Communications Controller), which uses a NACC to connect multiple neuromorphic processors together for the purpose of building a large unified neuromorphic system.
This system is designed to run large neural networks and also supports real-time communication with the Host PC.&lt;/p&gt;

competition. The official website for the event is found at 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onelapofamerica.com&quot;&gt;onelapofamerica.com&lt;/a&gt;. Since the event was 
technically a competition, the events were time trials. Each team was scored 
and ranked based on how fast they completed each event. The results and 
rankings from the event can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onelapofamerica.com/history/ShowEventDashboard.do?eventId=39&quot;&gt;results 
page&lt;/a&gt;.
The car we used for the event is my dad’s 2017 Chevrolet Stingray. This put us 
in the SGT-1 BB and Stock - GT Classes, where we placed 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 
15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; respectively. Our overall standing was 63&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal, however, was not to place well, but to have fun, complete the event, 
and bring the car back home, and we completed all of these goals. The 
competition was long, but fun. Each day had roughly the same layout. We would 
wake up early, around 7, then head to the track, where we would drive in two 
events. After which, we would then drive for around 500 miles to reach the next 
hotel, so that we could do it all again. The complete schedule for the event is 
show below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot; &quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day we packed up the car and traveled to the first hotel.
We knew we were at the right place when we saw a viper with one lap stickers 
and a Lamborghini next to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day of the event we added stickers to our car, went through tech

information book, and attended a drivers meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day of driving, we started off at the Tire Rack Headquarters where we 
drove on a wet skid pad. The goal was to see how much G-force you could put 
into turning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the skid pad, we then went to Grissom Air Force Base where my dad drove 
the autocross event. Before the event we both walked the course many times and 
discussed strategies on how to drive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We closed off the day by driving from Indiana to our hotel in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3-nelson-ledges-garrettsville-ohio&quot;&gt;Day 3 Nelson Ledges, Garrettsville, Ohio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day of driving, we were at Nelson Ledges Road course. We got their 
early enough that we were able to walk around the course before the track went 
live. There was an old bridge that went over the starting line. The bridge 
would shake when cars passed under it. My dad drove the course, but there were 
parade laps after lunch that I drove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-4-road-america-plymouth-wisconsin&quot;&gt;Day 4 Road America, Plymouth, Wisconsin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next track was Road America. In the morning there was rain and the track 
was very slippery. There were some wreaks as cars slid off of the track, so our 
run group at the end of the pack was delayed until after lunch. Going after 
lunch had the great benefit of allowing the track to dry and the sun to come 
up. This track was very large and there were many walking paths around the 
track and places to spectate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-5-brainerd-international-raceway-brainerd-minnesota&quot;&gt;Day 5 Brainerd International Raceway, Brainerd, Minnesota&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 5 was one of the nicest, sunniest, and longest days of the trip. In the 
morning I started to walk the course, but I only made it down the drag strip 
portion of the front straight before I realized just how long the total course 
would be. This track also had great places to spectate. The morning event was 
the large full course and I spectated the driving from the top of the sky box 
building. The track had a tunnel under the straight to cross from one side of 
the track to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we drove on the shorter SCCA road course portion of the 
track. This section of the track also had a rooftop to spectate from. The 
shorter course was fun to watch, since you could see for a greater percentage 
of the track and close to the start/finish line were fun turns to watch. 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Pastrana&quot;&gt;Travis Pastrana&lt;/a&gt; was fun to 
watch go around one of the turns in particular. He would power slide each time 
he went around. People spectating closer said that he was waving to the crowd 
of people watching while doing the power slide. In the morning run, he was 
talking on the phone with his teammates in the stands as he was driving around 
the track. It was great fun to hear his conversations/interviews and watch him 
drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we did drag racing on the front straight. The first time on the drag 
strip, you tried to see how fast you could go. Then they did a bracket race, 
where cars would try to get as close to their first time as possible without 
going over their previous time. In the bracket, they would start the cars at 
different times so that they should arrive at the finish line at the same time 
(assuming they ran the same time as before).  Finally to finish off the day, we 
had one of the longest transit drives of the trip, 555.5 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-6-motorsports-park-hastings-hastings-nebraska&quot;&gt;Day 6 Motorsports Park Hastings, Hastings, Nebraska&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hastings was a smaller course. We were able to walk the course in the morning. 
The weather was rainy and windy, but there were shelters from the rain. They 
had multiple covers and also a party bus. The party bus was nice since in 
addition to blocking the rain, it would block the wind. Even with a fire suit 
and multiple layers, it was cold this far north. This is also where our EZ pop 
up canopy finally collapsed. It was starting to look rough, and had already 
blown over once. This time we strapped it down really well with bags and 
hammock straps, and instead of blowing away, it folded in on itself. However, 
our stuff still stayed dry and we ended up not needing it for the rest of the 
trip. This place also had the best food. They had only one thing on the menu 
and it was a delicious brisket sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-7-blackhawk-farms-south-beloit-illinois&quot;&gt;Day 7 Blackhawk Farms, South Beloit, Illinois&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackhawk Farms was a nice course. By now we had the rhythm down. Wake up, get 
coffee, drive to course, walk course, morning session, lunch, afternoon 
session, transit drive, Cliff Bars and gas station pizza for supper, check-in 
and collapse in hotel bed. Repeat. By this point a nap was required, and I was 
glad to have brought a hammock to nap in. This track has a second story 
building to watch from, but the best place to watch was at some metal stands in 
the U portion of the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-8-national-corvette-museum-ncm-motorsports-park-bowling-green-kentucky&quot;&gt;Day 8 National Corvette Museum (NCM) Motorsports Park, Bowling Green, Kentucky&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove the events at NCM and it was a blast. The weekend before I went to a 
Chin Track Days here, so I already knew the course and had multiple sessions of 
experience driving it. In the morning, we first drove the east course, then 
afterwards we moved directly into line to drive the west course. Driving the 
split up course was new, but pit-in and pit-out was easy to find, and we looked 
for them when we walked on the course in the morning. I was able to run good 
times and I felt more confident on the track than I did during the week before. 
The previous experience helped tremendously. The sink hole portion was the most 
fun, and I was able to squeak the tires for most of the entrance turn. My time 
on the west course was comparably better, but the straights were to the 
advantage of our car. For lunch they had hibachi from a food truck. I was happy 
to have Asian after all of the BBQ I had been eating earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we drove on the full course. I enjoyed the full course and I was 
back in my comfort zone driving the same configuration I had during Chin. The 
laps were good and the only sad part was I forgot to hit record on the car’s 
race cam, so I don’t have any footage from that run. And without any proof to 
the contrary, those were my best laps on the track ☺.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the event, there was still time left for the track rental, so they opened 
up the track for open lapping. My dad was finally able to drive on the track at 
speed. Previously he had only done a parade lap on the course. This was the 
last track day, but we still had to drive back up to Indiana for the skid pad 
part 2, banquet, and group photo. So after being in Kentucky (closest 
destination to home) we heading back north for the last day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-9-skid-pad-south-bend-indiana&quot;&gt;Day 9 Skid Pad, South Bend, Indiana&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we line up all the cars to take a group photo. Then I got a chance to 
drive the skid pad again, but this time on a dry track. I did much better in 
the dry and I had more confidence to go fast. I think I was much closer to the 
limit of the tires this time around and the car was sliding around more. For 
this event they ran the cars in reverse order in the standings, and even so, it 
was great to hear that I took first place on the skid pad after completing my 
run. Finally the event ended with an awards banquet where the food was good and 
I learned what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_from_shoes&quot;&gt;shoey&lt;/a&gt; 
was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so after the banquet our trip was complete. We had successfully made it 
around One Lap of America. Tired but happy, we then made our last transit drive 
back home. At this point we were pros at long drives and we made it home 
safely.&lt;/p&gt;

The official website for the event is found at onelapofamerica.com. Since the event was technically a competition, the events were time trials. Each team was scored and ranked based on how fast they completed each event. The results and rankings from the event can be found on the results page. The car we used for the event is my dad’s 2017 Chevrolet Stingray. This put us in the SGT-1 BB and Stock - GT Classes, where we placed 17th and 15th respectively. Our overall standing was 63rd.</summary></entry></feed>
