For some reason, we keep coming back 🤪. I’m just kidding; it is a lot of fun.</p>

<p>This year, I edited the videos and compiled the pictures while in transit. I also started and completed going through <a href="/life/one-lap-of-america-2023/">last year’s pictures/videos</a>. 
This year, we got a nice rhythm down. After the event in the morning, I would take the first shift of the transit. Then, when we ran low on gas, we would stop at a gas station, and I would collect the SD cards to download and process the photos and video during the second transition before switching again and driving the rest of the transit for that day.</p>

<p>The One Lap of America official website is <a href="https://www.onelapofamerica.com">onelapofamerica.com</a>. 
Since the event was technically a competition, the events were time trials. Each team was scored and ranked based on how fast they completed each event.
The event results and rankings can be found on the <a href="https://www.onelapofamerica.com">One Lap of America website</a> under History -&gt; Previous One Laps. </p>

<p>My dad’s 2023 Chevrolet C8 Stingray has now completed two One Laps of America.
Our team number was 55, and we beat our number for the first time, finishing 50<sup>th</sup> overall. Our goal, as always, was not to place well but to have fun, complete the event, and bring the car back home, and we completed all of these goals. The track route was really nice this year, and the trip overall seemed easier this year than in past years. The time zones usually changed in our favor for the long days and we maintained good sleep starting out.</p>

This is our second time entering this driving competition; the last time we entered was in <a href="/life/one-lap-of-america/">2019</a>.
It took a full year until we went on our third One Lap of America (2024) before I got around to processing the videos and photos from 2023. 
The transit provided ample time for me to work on editing last year’s footage.
Eventually, I caught up, so I edited the footage from the morning when I was taking a break from driving in the afternoon.
We got a nice rhythm down. After the morning’s event, I would take the first shift of the transit. Then, when we ran low on gas, we would stop at a gas station, and I would collect the SD cards to download and process the photos and video during the second transition before switching again and driving the rest of the transit for that day.</p>

<p>The One Lap of America official website is <a href="https://www.onelapofamerica.com">onelapofamerica.com</a>. 
Since the event was technically a competition, the events were time trials. Each team was scored and ranked based on how fast they completed each event.
The event results and rankings can be found on the <a href="https://www.onelapofamerica.com">One Lap of America website</a> under History -&gt; Previous One Laps. </p>

<p>We took my dad’s new 2023 Chevrolet C8 Stingray this year.
We were not sure if it would arrive from the dealer in time, so we debated whether to take my brother’s Kia or my Beetle as a backup vehicle.
Luckily, it did come in in time for us to prepare the car and get it to One Lap.
We finished putting in the recommended miles on the car before it was track-ready during the transit to the start of One Lap.</p>

<p>Our car’s number this year was 37, and we finished 53<sup>rd</sup> overall. Our goal, however, was not to place well but to have fun, complete the event, and bring the car back home, and we completed all of these goals.
The competition was long, but fun. 
Each day, we had roughly the same schedule.
We would wake up early, around 7, and then head to the track, where we would drive in two events. 
After which, we would drive for around 500 miles to reach the next hotel, so we could do it all again.</p>

After the morning’s event, I would take the first shift of the transit.

<p>When I started heavily using Linux in college and started customizing and creating configuration files, I quickly needed a way to store, backup, and set up my various configuration dotfiles.
A logical place to store configuration files is in git.
You can see modifications to the dotfiles, easily commit new changes, and even make multiple branches if you need different versions of the dotfiles.
I do not remember the exact tutorial I followed, but a form of the method I used seems to be floating around on the internet in multiple blog posts.
<a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/managing-your-dotfiles-with-git-4dee603a19a2">Managing Your Dotfiles With Git</a> from 2020 seems to use the same method as me, and credits <a href="http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/">Using Git and Github to Manage Your Dotfiles</a> from 2012 for the method.
Given the age of the older post and how closely <a href="https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles">his example on GitHub</a> matches the first commit of my dotfiles repo, I would guess that this is the template I followed.</p>

<p>I started with a simple base and then built up the dotfiles and configuration over many years.
My dotfiles repository currently has 623 commits and was started in 2016.
The original structure from the example can still be found in my setup.
Therefore, instead of reproducing the same content as <a href="http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/">Using Git and Github to Manage Your Dotfiles</a>, I recommend you pause reading this blog and read about this method of storing dotfiles from the original blog post.</p>

<p><strong>Read <a href="http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/">Using Git and Github to Manage Your Dotfiles</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="my-public-dotfiles">My Public Dotfiles</h2>

<p>Now that you have read about the dotfile setup, you know how the dotfile directory is stored in git.
A setup script is used to create symlinks from the configuration files in the home directory to point back to configuration files in the dotfiles folder.
I have multiple branches in my dotfiles repo.
I have one main branch which I use on my personal Linux machines; then I also have a branch, that I used on the University machines at school, a branch that I use on machines at work, and a branch that I use on WSL machines.
Each of these types of machines has some deviations from the main branch, but I periodically compare the contents back to the main branch to ensure that all the good features are present in all and that the places they diverge still apply.
Since some of these configuration files are specific to work or to my own machines, I decided to make a public dotfiles repo, where I will copy the content of my dotfiles which is not sensitive and which is generic across the branches and that I think will be of general use and interest.
<strong>This public dotfiles repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Geekdude/dotfiles">https://github.com/Geekdude/dotfiles</a></strong>.
I hope you find my dotfiles interesting and helpful as you create your own dotfiles repository.</p>

<p>As you create your own dotfiles repository, I recommend that you start from a simple base, go through example configurations, and understand what the configuration lines are doing.
Then you can copy in the lines which change the configuration in a way that you like. <em>Don’t just use public configuration examples without taking the time to understand what the configuration is doing.</em>
You probably do not want parts of my configuration, but some of it you will likely find helpful.
I enjoy learning about the features of other people’s configurations and potentially incorporating some of the configurations into my own config.
My configurations started simple and grew over time as I wanted my system to behave differently and searched for a solution or saw a cool configuration on the internet or from colleagues.
Sometimes I ran into a specific problem and found the solution in a configuration change, then incorporated the change into my configuration files.</p>

<p>Over time I also changed the programs I use, so I have some older configuration files for these programs, even though I do not use these programs as much.
I also changed which shell I use primarily.
I started with Bash, then switched to Zsh for the added features.
Now I am currently using Fish.
I still keep my Bash and Zsh config in case I go back to these shells, but I primarily use Fish now.
One downside to Fish, is that it is not compatible with Bash, so I still find myself going back to Bash or Zsh frequently to run Bash scripts.
I liked the general look I had for Bash, so I kept the same general look as I configured Zsh and Fish.</p>

<p>Now that you know the general dotfile setup and have access to my public dotfiles, I will talk in more detail about my dotfiles, and as I do, you are free to look through the dotfile repository as well.
I tried to be clear in the comments of the dotfiles with what the configuration lines do, and in this blog post, I will give broader information about the features and reasoning behind the setup.</p>

<h2 id="readmemd">README.md</h2>

<p>The README file goes over how to set up the dotfile configuration on a new system.
From the steps, you can see how the relatively simple process is made more difficult when I need to use ssh keys to pull from a private repository.</p>

<h2 id="makesymlinkssh">makesymlinks.sh</h2>

<p>This file creates the symlinks for the dotfiles back to the corresponding file in the dotfiles directory.
Over time, this script was also extended to pull and update external submodules, create other additional symlinks, and link symlinks to folders. 
This script is run to set up all the dotfiles.
I have more submodules listed in .gitmodules than I actually use.
That is why I explicitly list the submodules I want in the script.
This is primarily done since it is much easier to add a new submodule than to remove it, and I might want to use it again.</p>

<h2 id="ssh">Ssh</h2>

<p>In my private dotfiles repo, I keep passcode protected and GPG encrypted ssh keys.
The makesymlinks.sh script will call the command to decrypt the keys as part of the setup.
In practice, I have to add the keys before I can clone the dotfiles directory, and I have to manually set up the symlink to .ssh.
That’s is the problem with using a private dotfiles repo; the keys need to be in place before you can clone the repo.
I also use a .ssh/config file to configure connections to remote machines.
Since the information in .ssh is sensitive, I have not included any of it in the public dotfiles repo.</p>

<h2 id="git">Git</h2>

<p>The git configuration is stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitconfig</code>, global git ignores are stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitignore_global</code>, and my git hook templates are stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git_template</code>.
I removed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user.name</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user.email</code> config items from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitconfig</code>, but those can be easily added back when git prompts you to set them.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare 4</a> as my main diff tool.
I also added other tools with aliases.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vimdiff</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vimmerge</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gvimdiff</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gvimmerge</code> use Vim and GVim respectively to perform the diff or merge.
I also found <a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic">difftastic</a>, which is a better terminal diff than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code> and is aliased to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">difft</code>.
My favorite alias, which I use all the time, is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tree</code>, which prints out a nice tree view of the git log. 
Other aliases are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sup</code> which recursively updates all submodules, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sfor</code> is an alias to run a for loop over all submodules.
I also have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hash</code> which prints out the current git hash, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>, which prints out the top-level directory of the git repo.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> might be a misleading name, but I can remember it easily.
Finally, I also have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code>, which prints the status or diff of the current directory respectively.</p>

<p>My template directory has the necessary hooks to set up ctags.
These ctags are then used by my Vim configuration to jump to tags in my file quickly.
Each time a git operation occurs the, ctags are regenerated, which keeps them up-to-date.
My global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitignore_global</code> ignores the generated ctag files.
Ctags are further discussed in my <a href="/tech/ctags/">Ctags blog post</a></p>

<p>I like to use fast-forward-only so that I have to explicitly choose to make a merge.
That way, it is easier for me to pick to merge or to rebase instead of defaulting to merge.</p>

<h2 id="fish">Fish</h2>

<p>I like to use the <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a> shell.
I think it is a well-designed shell with an easy-to-understand configuration structure.
Out of the box, it has many of the features by default that are a pain to set up in Zsh.
I was also able to keep the same basic theme as my previous shell configurations.
Some of my favorite features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic prediction and auto-completion of commands based on previously used commands.</li>
  <li>Command completion based on man pages. (I also have a function, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fish_add_completions</code>, to generate a manpage from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--help</code> output, and reload the man completions so that programs I write can have easy command completions)</li>
  <li>Powerful prompt with git status, exit code, time, and the duration of the last command.</li>
  <li>Easy configuration with a conf.d for config files and functions for custom functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>My <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.fish</code> has inline comments describing what everything does.
One thing to point out is that I call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setxkbmap</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcape</code> commands to replace capslock with control/escape and both shifts with capslock.</p>

<p>Inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conf.d</code> I have configuration files broken down by the name of what they are configuring.
Any file in this directory will be included in the configuration of Fish.
I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh_agent.fish</code> to make sure I always have an ssh-agent running.</p>

<p>Inside functions, I have all my custom functions.
In Fish, the prompts are just a shell function, so my prompt is defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fish_prompt.fish</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fish_right_prompt.fish</code>.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funcedsave.fish</code> combines the built-in <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/funced.html">funced</a> and <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/funcsave.html">funcsave</a> functions.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git-add-submodule.fish</code> adds an existing clone nested repository as a submodule of the parent.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git-reload-hooks.fish</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git-reload-hooks-all.fish</code> reload hooks based on the git template for either the current repo or recursively into all the submodules.</p>

<p>Something new I am trying is the <a href="https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher">fisher</a> Fish plugin manager with <a href="https://github.com/jethrokuan/z">z</a> for directory jumping.</p>

<h2 id="tmux">Tmux</h2>

<p>My Tmux config is set up to work with nested local and remote Tmux sessions. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmux.conf</code> specifies the local Tmux configuration and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmux/tmux.remote.conf</code> adjusts the status bar on the remote Tmux session.
&lt;F12&gt; is used to toggle the disable/enable of the outer Tmux session to make the inner Tmux session easier to work with.</p>

<p>My Tmux config also has mouse support, plugins to show resource monitoring, and more Vim-like bindings.</p>

<p>I spent a while figuring out the full-color range for both Tmux and Fish, and the color settings at the top of the file seem to work.
Since I use MobaXTerm, which has some nifty features that only work if Bash is your default shell, I use Tmux to set my default shell to Fish.
That way, Fish is started anytime I start my Tmux session.</p>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code>, I also have some helpful Tmux scrips.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmuxes</code> opens or connects to a new single Tmux session with the same view as a previous connection.
This command only opens a common Tmux session, and multiple sessions will follow the same cursor.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmuxs</code> also opens the same Tmux session, but this time it creates a new view into it so that the cursor does not follow the previous window.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmux_allow</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmux_disallow</code> changes the permissions of the Tmux socket to allow other users on the same machine to connect to the same Tmux session.</p>

<h2 id="vim">Vim</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as my main text editors.
Vim is still the editor that I am the most proficient with and also the one that I have customized the most.
With the various plugins I have, my Vim behaves more like a modern tool like Visual Studio Code compared to the vanilla Vi editor.
I have and still use Vim as a code editor, word processor, note taker, and documentation writer, and various plugins make it more suited for these tasks.
To learn about the plugins I use see <a href="/tech/vim-plugins/">My Favorite Vim Plugins</a>.
These plugins are installed using <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen</a>, and the plugins are added as submodules to my dotfiles repo. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makesymlinks.sh</code> is used to initiate and update the submodules.
Some of the plugins I have modified and the submodules point to my forks of the original repos.</p>

<p>Just like with my other config files, I have inline comments to explain my configuration.
However, I will mention here some specific features I have.
See my <a href="/tech/ctags/">Ctags blog post</a> for more information on how Ctags is set up.
I like to use three spaces by default, even though that seems like a chaotic-neutral choice on the alignment chart.
I have a check which disables many features when the text file is over 10MB.
With this setting, Vim can open humongous text files that break most other text editors.
I have a function that automatically strips trailing whitespace from files on save except when editing markdown files since trailing whitespace has meaning in markdown.
To help see trailing whitespace in those file formats, I add a · in place of the trailing space.
I created my own color scheme, which is a modification of the default color scheme.
I also set up proper 256 and GUI colors so that the color scheme looks good.</p>

<p>I added two useful functions for when I edit text.
To make line diffing of text easier, and since LaTeX and Vim treat newlines without a blank as part of the same paragraph, I write one sentence per line in the source document.</p>

<div class="language-vim highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">" Search for paragraphs that do no end in a newline.</span>
nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">l</span><span class="p">&lt;</span>space<span class="p">&gt;</span> /<span class="p">[.!</span>?<span class="p">]</span><span class="s1">'\?'</span>\?\zs\s\<span class="p">+</span>\ze\<span class="p">(</span>\<span class="k">w</span>\\<span class="p">|</span>\\\<span class="p">)&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;leader&gt;l&lt;space&gt;</code> is pressed, the sentence ending periods that are not followed by a newline are searched for and highlighted.
When a visual selection is made, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;leader&gt;l&lt;space&gt;</code> is pressed, the newlines are added to the selected region.
This makes it easy to reformat text note in the one sentence per line format to this format.
Just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">J</code> to join all the lines in a paragraph, then press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;V&gt;</code> then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;leader&gt;l&lt;space&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:DuplicateTabpane</code> is useful for quickly duplicating your current window layout to a new tab. Then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:TabooRename</code> can be used to rename the tab to a new name.</p>

<p>Here are my keybindings that I use when working with vim-zettel:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Zettel Vim Keybindings

&lt;leader&gt;zs  ZettelSearchMap
&lt;leader&gt;zy  ZettelYankNameMap

<h2 id="basic-apt-installs">Basic Apt Installs</h2>

<p>This script is used to update and upgrade apt packages, then install a common set of apt packages that I expect every system to have.
Between the dotfiles repo, this script, and Synology drive, I can go from a fresh Ubuntu install to a configure system very quickly.
This is useful since I redo my computers frequently or set up a new virtual machine.</p>

<h2 id="bin">Bin</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-thumbnails</code> is used to reduce the resolution of images to create thumbnail versions.
I use this for my website to reduce the size of the smaller images in a gallery.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdf-shrink</code> reduces the size of PDFs by calling other commands with the correct arguments.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esv</code> uses the <a href="https://www.esv.org">ESV</a> API to create a terminal program to read or listen to the bible.
If you want to use this program, you will first have to generate an API token from <a href="https://api.esv.org/">ESV.org</a>.</p>

<p>Reorder is a program I wrote and is discussed in the <a href="/tech/reorder/">Reorder blog post</a></p>

<h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>

<p>Here I store all the fonts I want to use across my machines.
Then, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makesymlinks.sh</code> will create a symlink to the local font location and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fc-cache</code> to cache the fonts so that they are properly installed as locally installed fonts.
I did not include the fonts in the public repo since I didn’t want to check the licensing on each font.</p>

<h2 id="inkscape">Inkscape</h2>

<p>I set up Inkscape with the extensions I use. I created my own addition to circuit symbols to make a black box symbol.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-zork">Bonus: Zork</h2>

<p>No system is complete without Zork, so as a bonus, I install Zork by default.</p>]]></content><author><name>Aaron Young</name><email>youngar@ornl.gov</email></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="Linux" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I started heavily using Linux in college and started customizing and creating configuration files, I quickly needed a way to store, backup, and set up my various configuration dotfiles.

<p><a href="/assets/productivity-presentation.pdf">Personal Knowledge Base and Productivity Presentation Slides</a></p>

<p><strong>TLDR: Look through the slides, and then read my commentary below for more information on interesting looking slides.</strong></p>

<p>In October last year, I gave a presentation to my group at ORNL on my productivity/note-taking/engineering-notebook system.
Another word for this system is a Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) or a second brain.<sup id="fnref:PKM" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:PKM" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
This system is inspired by many different systems, and I find it extremely valuable while conducting research.
If you are a knowledge worker or student, you will likely find this system useful also.
In lieu of a regular written article style blog post, I decided to try something different;
I will provide the slides for you to look at, then write my commentary for each slide below for you to read along with the slides.
This will save me some effort in restructuring the content of the talk, and it is helpful to look at the pictures that go along with the writing.
So for each slide, I will have a section of written commentary on that slide, and you can progress through the slides as you are reading the corresponding section.
In the slides, there are many links to internal and external information.
Any blue text is an internal link to another location in the slide deck, and any purple text is an external link for more information.</p>

<p>So without further ado, welcome to my written presentation on productivity.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-building-a-second-brain">Part 1: Building a Second Brain</h2>

<p>In this first part, I talk about the most influential system on my own system, that of Building a Second Brain from Tiago Forte.</p>

<h3 id="slide-2--information-scarcity-vs-information-abundance">Slide 2 — Information Scarcity vs Information Abundance</h3>

<p>We now live in a time of information abundance.<sup id="fnref:BASB" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:BASB" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
Much of the challenge in a knowledge based field such as research or academia comes from the overwhelming explosion of information that is now readily available in digital formats.
If the bodies of written wisdom in books were not overwhelming enough, you now have the entirety of the internet, electronic document repositories, email, multiple messaging applications, many code repositories, and a plethora of tools and open-source programs/libraries.
Most of this talk aims at techniques that can be used to avoid drowning in this abundance, and instead, of how to use this abundance to your advantage to thrive and become more productive.</p>

<p>One of the challenges to overcome is to stop living like information is scarce and start living like it is abundant.
This means that not everything can be watched or listened to, so you have to be selective about what you give your attention to and be OK with putting it down early if it is not as helpful as your thought.
It means that information can be shared instead of hoarded.
With scarcity, you could miss out on important information and potentially consume the entire available knowledge on a topic; with abundance, there is no end to the stream of information, and you dip in and out of the stream as needed and collect the best information into your own pool of knowledge.</p>

<p>The amount of knowledge that must be managed in daily life is overwhelming, and the solution to thriving instead of sinking in the abundance is to build a second brain or personal knowledge base.
This second brain will be a place for you to store and process your thoughts along with the abundance of external information.</p>

<h3 id="slide-5--building-a-second-brain">Slide 5 — Building a Second Brain</h3>

<p>This next section of the talk is all about the concepts found in <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Building a Second Brain</a>; although I haven’t taken the course, I have been learning about Building a Second Brain (BASB) through free online resources made available from Forte Labs.
There are many links on my slides, and they lead to useful resources or back to the places the information came from.
The Miro Board and the Illustrated notes are both great resources created by prior students of the class, but it helps to watch some of the free videos or read some of the free articles to understand the concepts.
I’m also greatly looking forward to the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Building-Second-Brain-Organize-Potential-ebook/dp/B09LVVN9L3/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1649119407&amp;sr=8-1">upcoming book on BASB</a>.</p>

<p>For each of my slides on a note-taking method, I will provide resources for further reading and key concepts from the method.
I am unable to go into too much detail on each method, but I wanted to cover the concepts that are the most helpful to me.</p>

<p>This slide covers the major ideas of BASB.
As presented in the <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lEwGSa8=/">Miro Board</a>, I broke the content down into the steps of the productivity pipeline, which are C.O.D.E., Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express.
For each of these steps, Tiago presents a concept, technique, and exercise for the step.
The place where all these steps take place and where all the information is worked on is within the second brain.
On this slide, the blue links take you to another slide in the presentation.</p>

<p>The key concepts listed in the bullets are the previously talked about information scarcity vs information abundance mindsets and the capture criteria of “capture what resonates with you.”
The things that you find interesting or grab your attention are the things you should capture in your second brain.</p>

<h3 id="slide-6--building-a-second-braincapture">Slide 6 — Building a Second Brain—Capture</h3>

<p>The first step in BASB is to have universal <em>capture</em>, and it is about collecting all interesting information.
Anything you consume or create, or learn about should be able to be easily captured in the second brain.
The second brain should have a universal inbox where anything that captures your attention and resonates with you can be frictionlessly added to the second brain inbox.
The capture needs to be frictionless, otherwise its tempting to be too lazy to capture the information, or the capture process will be too slow for live capture.
For this step, don’t worry about where the information will go; just focus on having a method of capture that takes no effort.</p>

<h3 id="slide-7--para">Slide 7 — PARA</h3>

<p>The second step of <em>organize</em>, is about where to put all the things that you have now captured in your universal inbox.
The method used is <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">PARA</a>.
In addition to the main four locations, I always include an additional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> as the inbox where everything can be initially placed before it is organized where it should go.
By having a capture place, you don’t have to think about where something should go as you are capturing it.</p>

<p>The key principles of PARA are that you leverage the magic number 4, which is easily in the working memory of humans.
You have four categories, and each category tree should only have a depth of 4.
The second idea is that you mirror this PARA structure across all the applications you use.
Even if you can’t use only one program or file system, you can still replicate the same general structure across each.
The last idea is that it separates actional items from non-actionable items.</p>

<p>The categories of PARA are Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive.
Projects have a deadline, and they are the things you are actively working on.
In my case, they are the active projects that I am currently working on.
The scope of my projects is longer running (multiple years), but I can still keep all the information on that project in one place where I will want it in the future.
This has helped me to context switch between projects even when I have to put them down for weeks at a time.</p>

<p>Areas are categories of responsibility that are never-ending.
These are obligations and things you must do but have no end, such as performance reviews, calls for papers, and weekly reviews.
I also put notes on working with particular vendors in the areas section.</p>

<p>Resources are things that you want to keep around for reference, things that are still generally relevant, but you have no project or areas using them.
(If a project or area was using the note, then it would go there instead.)
I keep my notes on academic papers here, as well as general notes.</p>

<p>Archive is for completed projects, areas that are no longer relevant, and notes that you want to keep but you don’t want in the resources category.
If something had no future use, then you can remove it, but I tend to the digital hoarder side, so if I think it had future potential use, but I don’t want to have it in the main categories, I will move it to archive.
In my archive, I also have the subfolders: projects, areas, and resources.
That way, when I’m looking for an archived item, I can find it in the same PARA structure.</p>

<p>When naming PARA folders, I suggest naming them <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0 Inbox</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 Projects</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2 Areas</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3 Resources</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4 Archive</code>, so that the order is maintained when sorted.
PARA is a useful and convenient organization method, and it places the things that you access more frequently at the top, with things you are less likely to use at the bottom.
Using search to look in resources and archive is very helpful, and for these categories, I mostly access them via the search bar, whereas projects and areas I normally navigate to without search.</p>

<h3 id="slide-8--para">Slide 8 — PARA</h3>

<p>This image shows how I use the same PARA structure in multiple places.
This helps me stay organized and switch between programs with less friction.</p>

<h3 id="slide-9--progressive-summarization">Slide 9 — Progressive Summarization</h3>

<p>We are now in the <em>distill</em> part of CODE.
In this step, the notes you have captured and organized are refined into more useful and beneficial notes.
I use the distill step to both progressively summarize notes and also to create index pages and build the internal linking between notes. Index pages are pages which summarize a topic or provide additional structure by linking to other pages.
Index pages are also a landing page for knowledge on a particular topic.</p>

<p>For progressive summarization, each time you touch a note, you try to make it easier for your future self to skim next time.
So each time you look at it, you can add another level of the summarization.
The idea here is that the summarization happens over many passes of working with the note.
Each time you touch a note, try to leave it a little better than you found it.
Add more links, summarize, or add clarification to the notes.</p>

<p>Another idea is that a wall of text is hard to read, but text with bolding and highlighting, text that has the main points pulled out, is easy to skim and to remind yourself of the content quickly without having to do a full read.
This allows notes to be reviewed by yourself very quickly at a glance.</p>

<p>The basic five levels of progressive summarization are shown in the slide.
For more information on progressive summarization, see <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/">Progressive Summarization: A Practical Technique for Designing Discoverable Notes</a></p>

<h3 id="slide-10--progressive-summarization-landscape">Slide 10 — Progressive Summarization Landscape</h3>

<p>This slide shows the landscape of notes which have been progressively summarized.
Each node is at a different point of the summarization process, with untouched nodes still lower in the stack, but certain high-quality, relevant notes have been through all the steps.
This makes a landscape of knowledge with the most relevant notes standing out amongst the others.</p>

<h3 id="slide-11--intermediate-packets">Slide 11 — Intermediate Packets</h3>

<p>With Intermediate Packets, we are now in the <em>express</em> part of CODE.
Here is where notes are mature enough that you create something from them.
My blog posts represent completed packets, but you can also have progress reports, one-slide summaries, and many other types of intermediate packets.
An intermediate packet is just the encapsulated work where you create something that can be shared with others.
It goes along with the saying, “We only know what we make”, so by creating content, you learn and create something of value to share.</p>

<h3 id="slide-12--ways-of-creating-intermediate-packets">Slide 12 — Ways of Creating Intermediate Packets</h3>

<p>This slide covers the activities that result in intermediate packets.</p>

<h3 id="slide-12--kinds-of-intermediate-packets">Slide 12 — Kinds of Intermediate Packets</h3>

<p>This slide shows additional examples of intermediate packets.</p>

<h3 id="slide-13--divergence-and-convergence">Slide 13 — Divergence and Convergence</h3>

<p>Now that we have covered the tools to <em>capture</em>, <em>organize</em>, <em>distill</em>, and <em>express</em>, let’s look at the complete process as a whole in more detail.
From the starting point, you explore and capture and learn all you can.
This is the divergence of information.
Then when you distill, you start to exploit what you have learned and condense it down into something that you want to express and turn into a final deliverable.
This pattern goes along with the idea of exploration vs exploitation found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed bandit machine learning problem</a>.
Each project you work on should have a similar pattern of breathing in a breadth of information and then breathing out a distilled, condensed deliverable from the information you gathered.</p>

<h3 id="slide-14--just-in-time-project-management">Slide 14 — Just-in-Time Project Management</h3>

<p>Also known as the being a lazy project manager.<sup id="fnref:LDM" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:LDM" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>I like to combine this idea with lazy note-taking and other just-in-time activities, like lazy progressive summarization.
Basically, you do the work when you need to, while reusing, and rehashing previous research and effort.
Lazy performance reviews are built from lazy quarterly reports which are built from lazy weekly updates, which are built from a lazy daily log.
Basically, at each step, I reuse parts from the previous step so that no part of the process is all that difficult.
I lazily improve my notes as I work with them.
Each time I don’t put in that much effort to improve them, but over time they are very valuable.
More in line with the lazy project cycle, the artifacts from previously completed projects are then recycled back into the second brain to become useful components for future projects.</p>

<h3 id="slide-15--101-principles-for-building-a-second-brain">Slide 15 — 10+1 Principles for Building a Second Brain</h3>

<p>These are the 10 (plus a bonus) principles for building a second brain.
I think they are fairly clear from the slide.
These are the core ideas for building a second brain.
For more details, listen to <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/basbpodcast">Tiago’s Podcast</a> or read <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-10-principles-of-building-a-second-brain/">The 10 Principles of Building a Second Brain</a>.</p>

<h3 id="slide-16--solution-to-information-overload">Slide 16 — Solution to Information Overload</h3>

<p>Taking the second brain concepts and CODE process together, the second brain becomes a solution to information overload where you repeatedly follow the steps on this slide.
These steps are similar to the process of Getting Things Done (GTD).</p>

<h2 id="part-2-other-personal-knowledge-base-systems">Part 2: Other Personal Knowledge Base Systems</h2>

<p>Now I transition to talking about other systems that have had an influence on my own system.</p>

<h3 id="slide-18--commonplace-book">Slide 18 — Commonplace Book</h3>

<p>The main takeaway from this system is that it is a common, central resource for everything.
This has inspired me to store everything I find meaningful in my PKB.
The other key idea is to always have a way to be able to take quick notes and add to the commonplace book.
The way I incorporate this idea, is that I used to carry around a moleskin notebook, and I still have an active bullet journal, but now since I use OneNote heavily, I can just add a note from anywhere from my phone to my OneNote inbox.
The last key concept is to use the commonplace book to keep from forgetting thoughts and ideas.
“A thought you don’t write down is as good as a thought you never had.”</p>

<h3 id="slide-19--bullet-journal">Slide 19 — Bullet Journal</h3>

<p>The way I rapidly log my daily engineering journal is very similar to the Bullet Journal method.
The advantage of the digital OneNote version is that it is easy to create links from the bullet to another page with more detail.
(Although the same could easily be done on paper with a page reference at the end of the line.)
I also keep a personal analog bullet journal, and I am now on volume 4.</p>

<p>One other tidbit I found useful is that after I finish a bullet journal, I can copy the index into OneNote so that when I am searching for a topic, I find the item in the index and know where to look in the physical book.
Another interesting idea from Bullet Journal, is that you can create different “Collections,” which are just a fancy way of saying pages with a particular layout and use.
Since these collections are created on a blank sheet of paper, the concepts can translate to any medium.
The default collections presented by Bullet Journal are very useful for pen and paperwork, but the same types of tools might be implemented automatically by a digital tool or can be included as pages in the digital tool.</p>

<h3 id="slide-20--zettlekästen-luhmanns-slip-box">Slide 20 — Zettlekästen (Luhmann’s Slip-Box)</h3>

<p>The Zettlekästen was a second brain created entirely using index cards for notes.
These notes then had many internal references to other notes, which built up a huge web of knowledge.
Related notes are linked to other related notes.
Although the filing cabinets full of notes are impressive, this system translates well to digital systems where hyperlinks can be made between notes.
A key of this system is that you need a unique identifier for each note so that you can create links to it.
The system is valuable from the emerging connectivity between ideas.
Each idea should be atomic and stand on its own, with one idea per note.
The system is expandable in any direction and represents the wavefront of your knowledge in each area.</p>

<p>Another key idea is that there are multiple types of notes and that each node should be handled differently and used differently.
These note types are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fleeting Notes — Quick notes to remind you of an idea, they will be turned into a permanent note and then discarded.</li>
  <li>Literature Notes — Notes on a piece of writing that are tied to the bibliography of the source for future citing.</li>
  <li>Permanent Notes — Notes in your own words that are refined so that they are atomic and can stand alone. These are added to the slip-box and never removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This system was created with writing academic papers in mind, and the book <em>How to Take Smart Notes</em> goes over the writing method as well as the Zettlekästen design.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-note-taking-tools">Part 3: Note Taking Tools</h2>

<p>In this part, I go over a comparison of methods for taking notes and the tools that could be used for note-taking.</p>

<h3 id="slide-22--note-taking-comparisons">Slide 22 — Note-Taking Comparisons</h3>

<p>These slides are a series of versions of statements with different note-taking styles compared.
In each case, I think both sides are useful and can be used together.</p>

<h4 id="knowledge-network-vs-knowledge-hierarchies">Knowledge Network vs Knowledge Hierarchies</h4>

<p>This is comparing a more traditional index as you would find in a book with the web of links you would find on a wiki page.
I think both organizational methods are good.
A hierarchy is good for locating a note manually, and a web of links is great for representing connections between notes.
In my system, I use OneNote with a <a href="#slide-7--para">PARA</a> organizational hierarchy for placing notes in a notebook, then I make heavy use of internal links and index pages to re-represent information and connect related information together.</p>

<h4 id="search-vs-locate">Search vs Locate</h4>

<p>Notes can either be searched for using the search bar of an application or they can be located based on their location in the notebook.
As I mentioned in the <a href="#slide-7--para">PARA</a> section, I used both methods.
When I am switching contexts between projects, and I know where the notes are located, I navigate to them directly by clicking on them in the hierarchy.
If I’m looking for a resource page, I will jump to it quickly by searching for the name of the resource.
Sometimes I do both; I search for an index page by name, then I click on the link to the place I want to go.
Other times I’m not sure what I am looking for, and I leverage the power of search to look for keywords on a page where I’m not sure what I will find.
With these kinds of searches, I’m sometimes surprised that I have notes on a topic that I forgot about.</p>

<h4 id="one-note-per-source-vs-one-note-per-idea">One Note per Source vs One Note per Idea</h4>

<p>How much information should be on each note?
Again the answer depends.
For myself, if I am taking notes on a resource, I will create one note per source of information.
Then as I process the ideas, I will switch to one note per topic.
If an idea is a big idea or stands alone, I will then move it to its own note.
By in large, I have medium-length notes and try to keep the note length to what can be easily scrolled through.
If a note is too long, I will look for ways to break it up.
I don’t often mind notes being short, but I don’t want to fill my notebook sections with too many small notes.</p>

<p>I think the best solution to this problem is to reduce the granularity at which you can create internal links.
OneNote almost has the right idea here with the ability to create internal links to paragraphs; however, the implementation is bad, and these kinds of links are fragile.
Most systems support linking to a heading, this is generally still close enough to get you to the right location in the notes.
The key here is that the link between content should make it obvious to what you are linking to.
If you take long pages of notes, then a link at the page level is less useful than a link to a header or to a paragraph.</p>

<h4 id="fluid-vs-structure">Fluid vs Structure</h4>

<p>The idea here is whether one should have a strict structure or template for notes, or if each note should have a fluid ad hoc design.
Here again, I tend to the middle ground, where I found that for some types of notes, it is useful to have some common components; but by in large, I am fluid on a note-to-note basis, where each note builds up based on the content of the note.
Then if I want to restructure the note later, I can without too much difficulty.
So, in general, I start with a black page when I make a new note.
Some specific pages, like my weekly reports or bibliography notes have a more rigid structure.</p>

<h3 id="slide-23--consideration-for-a-note-taking-program">Slide 23 — Consideration for a Note-Taking Program</h3>

<p>Here I list of what I think should be important things to consider when you are selecting which note-taking program to use.
As an example, I will go through the list with my current program of choice, OneNote.</p>

<ol>
  <li>OneNote can easily capture any type of information, from typed notes to handwritten notes to webpages to whiteboards.</li>
  <li>OneNote has powerful search capabilities and can even search inside images and handwritten notes.</li>
  <li>OneNote is available on Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and via the web. So I can access it from anywhere.</li>
  <li>OneNote is backed up locally with the windows client and on the cloud.</li>
  <li>OneNote can encrypt certain notes with a password.</li>
  <li>OneNote has a default structure similar to physical notebooks with a Notebook → Section Group → Section → Page hierarchy. Other structures can be created via hyperlinks.</li>
  <li>OneNote can easily hyperlink to websites, files, sections, pages, or paragraphs.<sup id="fnref:paragraph" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:paragraph" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>OneNote makes it easy to move or reformat notes.</li>
  <li>This is one of the areas where OneNote does a bad job. It is difficult to import or export notes from other note-taking apps. OneNote does work OK with the rest of the office suite, and pages can be shared by email.</li>
  <li>Again here, OneNote is so-so. Attached files can be easily opened from OneNote, but the notes themselves cannot be edited directly by an external program.</li>
</ol>

<p>So based on these criteria, OneNote gets an 8 out of 10 with a few areas it could improve on.
OneNote is still my program of choice because of the ease of capture, ease of restructuring and reformating, power of the hyperlinks, and because of their unmatched support for the pen and handwritten note-taking with all the other features as well.
I won’t claim that OneNote is the best for handwritten notes, but it does seem to be the best for a hybrid of handwritten and typed notes.</p>

<h3 id="slide-24--note-taking-programs">Slide 24 — Note-Taking Programs</h3>

<p>Here is my list of good note-taking programs.
From this list, the ones I have used heavily are the paper lab notebooks, VimWiki, and OneNote.
I have also used Evernote to a lesser extent.
As mentioned prior, I keep a Bullet Journal and use OneNote for my digital notes.</p>

<p>The other programs on this list are highly recommended by the note-taking community, and I have installed and tried out most of them.
I put my short notes for each one on the slide.
Of this list, I am keeping a closer eye on Obsidian and Notion as both are gaining a lot of traction in the note-taking community.
Obsidian is my favorite markdown-based note-taking program, and Notion is my favorite collaborative system.</p>

<h2 id="part-4-my-personal-knowledge-base-system">Part 4: My Personal Knowledge Base System</h2>

<p>Here I go over my own personal system in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="slide-26--my-personal-knowledge-base-story">Slide 26 — My Personal Knowledge Base Story</h3>

<p>This slide goes over the progression of my PKB over time.
I first started with a custom duct tape folder with many nerdy features, which had a clipboard with my weekly task sheet.
That is what I used in high school to keep track of academic work.</p>

<p>For my personal journaling/note-taking, I started with a more traditional long-form journal in volume 1; then, for volume 2, I switched to a bullet journal style.
Now volume 4 is still using the bullet journal style.
I don’t use the handwritten notebooks as much, so it takes a few years for me to fill one up, but I like to still have it and use it.</p>

<p>Next, during internships, I used a physical engineering notebook where I kept all my notes.
This worked well when I was primarily only working on one project at a time, and it took a long time to fill up a single book.
I outgrew this system in grad school when I filled up notebooks and had more trouble finding previous notes. At this point I was using multiple three-ringed binders to keep my physical notes.</p>

<p>From there, I switched to VimWiki, which I used in the terminal on Linux, along with my code and paper writing in LaTeX.
The problem with VimWiki was that it was harder to capture images, and I still needed to do my visual thinking on paper since I like to think using handwriting.
I based my VimWiki on a <a href="https://biarri.com/an-efficient-and-effective-research-environment/">research structure I found on the internet</a>, then later, I restructured my VimWiki using a Zettlekästen style.
At this point, I was also trying out using a Rocketbook with Evernote to handle my handwritten notes.</p>

<p>Finally, we get to where I am now, which is using PARA with OneNote.
When I started my new job at ORNL, I switched to a windows machine for my main computer, and OneNote is a supported electronic lab notebook tool. I have greatly enjoyed using it, apart from a few various gripes.</p>

<h3 id="slide-27--demo-my-personal-knowledge-base">Slide 27 — Demo My Personal Knowledge Base</h3>

<p>During the actual talk, I gave a live demo of my note-taking system.
Since this presentation is written, I will give more details on my OneNote structure.</p>

<p>I’ve been using PARA with OneNote for work and personal use since I started my current job a year and a half ago.
I am a Software Engineer/Researcher for Oak Ridge National Laboratory, so I have many active projects and technical notes to keep track of.
My second brain stored in OneNote with PARA organization has been an indispensable resource to me.</p>

<p>My OneNote structure is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notebook for Work
    <ul>
      <li>Inbox</li>
      <li>Journal (Daily log of research activities)
        <ul>
          <li>I use my journal to track tasks I work on and links to meetings and note pages.</li>
          <li>I use note hierarchy to organize and minimize notes by year.</li>
          <li>At the bottom of the current month, I also keep my todo tasks list organized by project with a todo today, todo next, and todo inbox.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Notes (General notes. This could be in 3 Resources, but I keep it here since I add to it frequently. Notes in here I find primarily from search)</li>
      <li>[SG] 1 Projects
        <ul>
          <li>[SG] Name of first project
            <ul>
              <li>Notes - Name of first project</li>
              <li>Meetings - Name of first project</li>
              <li>Emails - Name of first project</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>[SG] Name of second project
            <ul>
              <li>….</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>[SG] 2 Areas
        <ul>
          <li>Various area sections and section groups</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>[SG] 3 Resources
        <ul>
          <li>Various resource sections and section groups</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>[SG] 4 Archive
        <ul>
          <li>Same PARA structure for inactive resources.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Personal Notebook
    <ul>
      <li>… similar PARA structure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>[SG] is a section group.</p>

<p>Tips and Tricks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Section groups are sorted alphanumerically, so you can use numbers to force a sort order. (i.e., “1 Projects”, “2 Areas”, …)</li>
  <li>Use hyperlinks and index pages.
    <ul>
      <li>You can hyperlink internally to any paragraph, this is super powerful, and I use it to link notes together in a Zettlekästen like web. I like the mix of hyperlinks and hierarchical sections for organizing notes—the best of both organization methods. Specific index landing pages with hyperlinks can be a view into your notes with a different organization.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add “- project name” to sections that have names that are the same in different section groups.
    <ul>
      <li>This makes it much easier to find the correct section to move an item to when you move a note.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Only put content in one place. Hyperlink if you want it somewhere else. This means I don’t copy notes; I just move them to the most logical place.</li>
  <li>I have found that OneNote is less keyboard friendly for key bindings, so I use a stream deck and macros to make it much easier to do common OneNote Operations.</li>
  <li>If you are using OneNote on a windows desktop, you can install Onetastic, which adds some missing features in OneNote and the ability to write advanced macros. (I wrote my own macros to make the conversion from my previous second brain in VimWiki to OneNote easier.)</li>
  <li>Integration with Outlook is great if your work also uses Outlook for email.</li>
  <li>Sending note pages via email also works great.</li>
  <li>Pen support with a pen display or iPad is great. So are pictures of whiteboards or screenshots of presentations. OneNote attempts to do OCR on pictures and handwriting with various levels of success. Still, it was good enough for me to rediscover useful information that I had written in cursive using search.</li>

<h2 id="part-5-productivity-tools">Part 5: Productivity Tools</h2>

<p>At this point of the talk, I switch from talking about PKB and start talking about various productivity tools for Software Engineers/Researchers.</p>

<h3 id="slide-29--useful-hardware-for-remote-work">Slide 29 — Useful Hardware for Remote Work</h3>

<p>On the slide is a picture of my remote work setup.
I found it great to have a pen display for digital handwritten notes and for remote whiteboarding.
A stream deck is wonderful for easily creating macros.
The best part is that since the buttons have a screen, you can see what each button will do.
When you switch programs, the macros switch as well.
The stream deck tasks some time to manually set up, but it is a joy to use and a great time saver once set up.
I especially like using it with OneNote since OneNote keybindings are limited, but with macros, I can leverage alt menu navigation to perform complex functions with a single button press.
I recommend having a nice docking station or a desktop computer.
In my setup, I have a dual laptop stand and USB Type-C dock, which works with both my personal and work computer.</p>

<p>Update: Now that I am working at the office, I have a similar setup at work so that it is easy to switch from at home and on-site work.</p>

<h3 id="slide-30--stream-deck">Slide 30 — Stream Deck</h3>

<p>This slide shows off some of my custom Stream Deck macro pages for various applications.</p>

<h3 id="slide-31--jabref">Slide 31 — JabRef</h3>

<p>JabRef is an amazing tool for managing bibliographies if you primarily write papers using LaTeX with the bibliographies in the BibTeX or BibLaTeX format.
I keep my JabRef bibliography in Git, and I have a personal repository and a shared repository within my group at ORNL.
I started using JabRef in grad school, and it continues to work well.</p>

<h3 id="slide-32--slack">Slide 32 — Slack</h3>

<p>This slide has some of the main tips for using slack from a slack training I attended.</p>

<h3 id="slide-33--project-management-in-gitlab">Slide 33 — Project Management in GitLab</h3>

<p>Project management in GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket is great, and I highly recommend leveraging the tools to manage projects.
One thing that has been useful for research projects is to create a project repo that tracks the project as a whole and can be used to store all the artifacts from the project.
The issue board can keep track of tasks and discussions on topics.
Separate code repos can be added to the project repo as submodules for organization.
READMEs and wikis can be used to keep shared knowledge on the project.</p>

<h3 id="slide-34--weekly-review">Slide 34 — Weekly Review</h3>

<p>I follow a process similar to <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-one-touch-guide-to-doing-a-weekly-review/">Tiago’s Guide to doing a weekly review</a>.
This process is helpful for me to keep my digital workspace uncluttered.</p>

<p>The next two slides are from <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-one-touch-guide-to-doing-a-weekly-review/">Tiago’s Guide to doing a weekly review</a> and highlight the process.</p>

<h3 id="slide-37--weekly-review">Slide 37 — Weekly Review</h3>

<p>This slide gives an overview of the steps to a weekly review, and I would recommend reading and watching Tiago’s material for more details on the process.</p>

<h3 id="slide-38--task-tracking">Slide 38 — Task Tracking</h3>

<p>I would recommend tracking tasks and using a productivity method similar to GTD.</p>

<h3 id="slide-39--time-tracking">Slide 39 — Time Tracking</h3>

<p>I used <a href="https://toggl.com/track/">Toggl Track</a> to track the time I spend on various projects.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<p>I included my summary of <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/">Tiago’s summary of How to Take Smart Notes</a>.</p>

Utterances’ is a great choice since it is open-source and uses the issues tracker of the GitHub repository to store the comments.

Now email notification works just like GitHub’s issue email notification system.
The main downside to Utterances is that you have to log in to a GitHub account in order to post a comment.
