### Work Experience
**University of Tennessee, Knoxville**
* January 2016--Present: Research with the TENNLab Neuromorphic Computing Research Group. See [Research]({% link _pages/research.md %}) for more information.
* August 2016--August 2017: Graduate teaching assistant for Dr. Plank. Led lab sections, graded labs, and helped students for Data Structures and Algorithms II, Systems Programming, and Advanced Programming and Algorithms.

**Garmin International, Inc., Olathe, KS**
* Summer 2015: On the Aviation Software-Navigation Library Team. Improved the Navigation Library by revising requirements, making changes to the code base, and creating new test cases.

**Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, Knoxville, TN**
* Summer 2014: Programmed slicing engine for use with ORNL's two large-scale additive manufacturing machines using C++ and C#. Software was used to print the [world's first 3D printed car](https://research.utk.edu/ut-engineering-students-help-ornl-local-motors-print-drivable-3d-car/).

**Siemens Medical Systems, Knoxville, TN**
* Summer 2013: Implemented embedded system control software using MQX RTOS on an ARM9 processor. Development included interfacing with GPIO, I&sup2;C, SPI, CANopen, RS-323, and Ethernet. Embedded software supported interfacing to LEDs, LCD, FPGA, Temperature and Humidity sensors, EEPROM, DACs, SFP+, and a Power Controller. Designed a C# testing interface to communicate with the processor over TCP/IP.

* Summer 2012: Designed a system using an Altera Stratix IV FPGA development board to read data from two TI 1 GHz ADCs. Developed a NIOS II FPGA soft-core running &micro;C/OS-II using Quartus II. Designed a C# application to interface with the development board using UDP/IP.

* Summer 2011: Used C# and ASP.NET to develop a database-driven website to keep track of employee's tasks.  Learned and utilized LINQ to access the SQL database records.
